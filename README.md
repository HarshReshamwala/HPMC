# Hard Particle Monte Carlo (HPMC) Simulations

This project involves simulating dense systems of hard particles using HOOMD-blue's Hard Particle Monte Carlo engine. The goal is to explore phase behavior, compression-induced ordering, and coexistence regimes across different particle types.

---

## Overview

- Implemented Monte Carlo compression workflows using HOOMD-blue.
- Simulated particle systems in both 2D and 3D with periodic boundaries.
- Post-processed trajectories using Freud for structural and phase analysis.
- Focused on analyzing solid-liquid phase coexistence and ordering transitions.
